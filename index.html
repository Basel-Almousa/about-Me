            <h3>When I Got Lost In The Middle Of No Where</h3>

            <p>My name is Basel Almousa, I graduated from the mechanical enginnering department after six years of study. I were studying in North Cyprus and its known as a multiculture country, so I got the opportunity to blend in many different nationalities. so ..... once upon a time, when I become the local leader for navy commanders in the western sea in the wonderland. Being a yearn for wanderlust in the middle of the seas gave me the success to be a stronge navy leader. It begun when I start designing small project related to a mechanical system. I reached up to fabulous level of thinking since I updated an engine called "stirling engine". During the cold war, this engine have been used in the Irelandish submerens to prevent the enemy radars to detect it, this is becouse the SE has an external combustion source of energy, so the radars will never be able to catch it. Plus, It has been used by NASA but stopped its report in 2003. </p>
